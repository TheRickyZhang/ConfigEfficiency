This repository contains my various configurations for...things! See usage below.

## 1a. `RickyHotkey.ahk`

General remappings for regular keyboards. Install [AutoHotkeyV2](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/) for running the .ahk file. Remaps keys within the OS, and can be extended to application-specific.

## 2b. `advantage360.txt`

Contains custom remappings for profile 1 of my Advantage 360 keyboard layout. Should NOT be combined with the autohotkey script.

## 3. `windows-setup.ps1`

All-encompassing script for windows configuration

### `powershell.ps1`

Activates default usage of Powershell 7 (the objectively better powershell) and command aliases.

### `git.ps1`

Activates helpful git configurations and aliases

### `improveWindows.ps1`

Improves Windows OS for the technically literate, such as removing annoying Edge searches. Also see `improveWindows.txt` for manual steps.
