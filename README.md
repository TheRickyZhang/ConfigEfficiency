This repository contains my various configurations for...things! See usage below.

## 1. `RickyHotkey.ahk`
Install [AutoHotkeyV2](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/) for running the .ahk file. Remaps keys within the OS, and can be extended to application-specific.

## 2. `powershell.md`
Default usage of Powershell 7 (the objectively better powershell) and command aliases.

## 3. `git.md`
A collection of global git configurations

## 4. `chromeExtensions.md`
Google Chrome extensions mainly for navigating tabs.
